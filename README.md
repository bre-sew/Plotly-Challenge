Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Data: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

Analysis Steps:
 1. Using plotly, create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
 2. Using plotly, create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
 3. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individualâ€™s demographic information.
 4. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
 5. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
 6. Create a dashboard for the analysis.
 7. Deploy your app to GitHub Pages.
